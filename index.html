<h2> The Bundle <br> of <span class="bundle">Sticks</span></h2>


<div class="Old">






    <p>An old man on the point of death cl√©ment lopez est mon ami summoned his sons around him to give them some parting advice.

He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son:

"Break it."

The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle.

The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful.

"Untie the faggots," said the father, "and each of you take a stick."

When they had done so, he called out to them:
"Now, break," and each stick was easily broken.

"You see my meaning," said their father.

<h2> The Cock <br> & the Jewel</h2>

<div class="mt-50px">



<p>A Cock, scratching for food <br>for himself and his hens, <br>found a precious stone;<br> on which he said:<br>

"If thy owner had found thee, and not I,<br> he would have taken thee up,<br> and have set thee in thy first estate; <br>but I have found thee for no purpose. <br>

I would rather have one barleycorn <br>than all the jewels in the world."</p>

<h2> <span class="lion">The Lion in <span class="love"> love</span></span></h2>

<div class="textelion">


<p>A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden <br>and proposed marriage to her parents.</p>

<p>The old people did not know what to say.<br>

They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, <br>yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.</p>

<p>At last the father said:<br>

"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, <br>but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, <br>and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection <br>you might possibly do her some injury</p>

<p> Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty <br>should have your claws removed, <br>and your teeth extracted, then we would <br>gladly consider your proposal again."</p>


<p class="moral">The Lion was so much in love that he had <br>his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.<br>

But when he came again to the parents of the young girl <br>they simply laughed in his face,<br> and bade him do his worst.
